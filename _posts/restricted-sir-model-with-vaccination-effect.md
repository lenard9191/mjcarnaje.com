title: "A Restricted SIR Model with Vaccination Effect for the Epidemic Outbreaks Concerning COVID-19 - Agent-Based Modeling"
excerpt: "In this paper, we propose a restricted SIR model with vaccination effect to study the epidemic outbreaks concerning COVID-19. The model is a system of ordinary differential equations with a time-dependent transmission rate and a vaccination rate. The basic reproduction number is derived and the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is analyzed. The model is applied to the COVID-19 outbreak in China and the United States. The numerical simulations show that the model can describe the epidemic outbreaks of COVID-19 in these two countries."

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. The disease is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then, the virus has spread rapidly around the world, leading to widespread illness, death, and economic disruption. In response to the pandemic, governments and public health authorities have implemented a range of measures to control the spread of the virus, including social distancing, mask-wearing, and lockdowns.
